        Why Are Glaciers melting?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Glaciers are melting due to rising global temperatures caused by human activity. Since the industrial revolution, increased greenhouse gas emissions have increased warming, specifically in the polar regions where glaciers are concentrated. This warming causes glaciers to retreat and calve more rapidly.
